Today, the technology exists as a support for all people, it has helped make our traffic signals work, allow us to use the internet, and even goes as far as powering our toaster at home. Our inspiration was the supporting role that technology plays in society today. With this project, we plan to expand that support to help a new category of people.

The project has 2 protocols, the blind protocol which is able to help the visually impaired user with visualizing the world around him through his other senses. The user at any time could ask the specto to take a picture. Specto could take a picture and will tell the user all the objects in the area and if there is any text in front of a user, like a book. It would read out the text for the user. Specto also has the ability to alert the user if there is a wall or object in front of the user, to guide the user through the world. Specto's deaf protocol is a web app that is able to detect any audio in the real world and turn it into text for the user to understand. The user could type back and it would turn in to audio for the other person to understand. These two protocols help support both blind and deaf people through their everyday life.
